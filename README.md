## About

I am a software engineering manager currently leading teams working on distrbuted data infrastructure platforms for large-scale AI/ML applications. I have significant experience in distributed computing and public cloud platforms. This includes building, growing and managing teams in these areas and taking projects from prototype to product. My [personal website](https://manastalukdar.github.io/) has more details on my professional experiences and interests, along with a blog containing articles, links, etc. related to software engineering and other topics of interest.
